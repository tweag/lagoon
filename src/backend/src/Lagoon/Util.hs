-- | Group by identity
--
-- The groups returned by 'groupBy' are guaranteed not to be empty, but this is
-- not obvious from the type. 'groupOn' is a variation in which elements are
-- given some kind of " identity " of type @b@, and we want to group elements
-- with the same identity. For each group we return we additionally return the
-- identity of the elements in that group.
--
-- NOTE: This version uses the standard Prelude 'span' function and as such is
-- not as lazy as one might wish. Not suitable for streaming.
